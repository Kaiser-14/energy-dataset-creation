# Run both services in the background. One is for enabling REST API server and other for gather data

# 1.- Connect via SSH
ssh arp@192.168.122.1
pass 4893

# 2.- Run Rest API server
# It will receive in the background requests from probe
# Server is always up and running, so you do not need to do nothing here
cd Downloads/GATV/5G-Energy
source venv/bin/activate
nohup /usr/bin/python3 server.py &

# 3.- Run data gathering
# It will request each 15 seconds data from server and add to server.txt file
# Before each collection, remember to remove server.txt
cd Downloads/GATV/5G-Energy
rm server.txt
source venv/bin/activate
nohup /usr/bin/python3 data_server.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# 4.- To stop the data collection
ps aux | grep python
# Look for the process data.server.py and find number process
kill NUMBER_PROCESS
# Return to step 3 to continue gathering data
